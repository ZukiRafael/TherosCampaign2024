## The shepherd of souls

Arthur was born under a blood-red moon, an omen some whispered was a sign of Artheros' favor. He wasn't a strong child, nor a particularly gifted one. Yet, a strange calmness resided within him. He wasn't afraid of death, a stark contrast to those surrounding him. His stillness when his parents perished proved to be too much for the elders of his village.  He soon found himself a pariah and decided to travel to far-off lands.

Stumbling onto Theros, his calmness amidst the chaos of battle drew the attention of a shadowy sect within Artheros' clergy dedicated to ensuring the smooth passage of souls or the prevention thereof. They saw Arthur as a vessel for their teachings. They trained him in the rituals of death, the art of wielding twilight magic, and the sacred duty of ushering souls to the underworld. He learned of the delicate balance – a natural order where life must inevitably give way to death. Arthur never reveled in death but embraced his role as a shepherd of souls, ensuring a peaceful transition and protecting those on the precipice of their final journey.

Arthur doesn't stand out in a crowd. His physical stature is average, and his demeanor is reserved. He wears simple, dark clothing with a silver pendant depicting the ferryman, symbolizing his sect. His robes are worn and frayed; when he stands at sunset, his robes reflect Nyx’s night sky.

## Pharika’s graps

The bustling city of Melis was a harsh introduction to life for Anteros. Abandoned by his family, he was alone and adrift in a sea of humanity. He was a child, barely old enough to understand the sting of betrayal, and utterly unprepared for the unforgiving streets. Hunger gnawed at his belly, and the nights were a symphony of unsettling sounds in the labyrinthine alleys he called home.

Driven by desperation, Anteros scavenged for scraps, pilfered what he could, and slept under the cold indifference of a city that never sleeps. One fateful day, while rummaging through a discarded pouch, he stumbled upon a vial filled with a vibrant green liquid. Hunger, not curiosity, was his first instinct. The liquid shimmered with an unnatural allure, and to his surprise, it tasted sweet and filling. No sooner had the last drop touched his lips than the world dissolved into a swirling vortex of darkness.

Days turned to weeks in Anteros's disoriented state. He found himself within a dreamscape, a twisted reflection of Melis bathed in an unnatural green glow. A monstrous figure, draped in shadows, loomed before him, its voice a cacophony of whispers. This was Pharika, the Gorgon goddess of poison and oracles, and she unveiled a horrifying truth – Anteros's life, or lack thereof, was now part of her grand design. The green ichor wasn't just sustenance; it was a binding pact.

When Anteros opened his eyes again, the harsh reality of Melis greeted him. But something had irrevocably changed. Gripped tightly in his hand was a blade, its surface etched with glowing green veins that pulsed with a faint life of its own. The whispers of the Gorgon goddess constantly tempt him towards darkness, urging him to become an instrument of her will. He fights to control the power coursing through him.

## The new oracle of Klothys

Elara isn't your typical oracle, shrouded in mysticism and cryptic pronouncements.  As the chosen vessel of Klothys, the embodiment of destiny, Elara embodies a sense of cold, unwavering certainty.  She doesn't see the future, she knows it.  Every thread of fate, every rise and fall, is laid bare before her gaze.

Elara wasn't born an oracle.  She was chosen.  Legends speak of a young woman tending sheep on a windswept mountaintop.  A colossal spider descended one starless night, its eight eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light.  It spun an intricate and vast web that encompassed the entire sky.  Elara stared, mesmerized, as the threads shifted and pulsed, revealing a tapestry woven from the very fabric of destiny.  The web was gone when she awoke the next morning, but the memory resided within her. She continues to seek solace in delving deep within the libraries that contain scattered remnants of the knowledge she was exposed to that fateful night.

Her neverending hunger for further understanding has driven her out of her secluded village to seek more knowledge. Leaving behind her family and possessions, she has descended onto the polis to find what she has been seeking: closeness to her forgotten god — Kloths.

  

## The scholar of Keranos

Kynos was not born into wealth or privilege. He grew up in the bustling port city of Lauria, a place teeming with secrets and whispers. His childhood was marked by the unsolved disappearance of his father, a sailor who vanished on a seemingly routine voyage. The Theban Guard dismissed it as a shipwreck, but young Kynos never accepted that explanation.

Fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a burning desire for truth, Kynos devoured every scrap of information he could find. He spent hours at the docks, questioning sailors and merchants, piecing together fragments of his father's last days. He haunted the libraries, immersing himself in ancient texts, philosophy, and the obscure lore of the sea.

His relentless pursuit of answers drew the attention of Elias, a retired Oracle interpreter known for his enigmatic pronouncements. Elias saw a spark in Kynos, a potential far greater than simply finding a lost sailor. He became Kynos' mentor, teaching him the art of deduction, observation, and the subtle language of clues hidden in plain sight.

Years passed, and Kynos honed his skills. He became known throughout Lauria as the "Hound of Thebes," a man who could sniff out the truth no matter how deeply buried.  His methods were unconventional. He observed details others missed, interpreted seemingly random events, and possessed an uncanny ability to connect seemingly disparate dots.  He wasn't a fighter, nor did he rely on magic. His weapon was his mind, a relentless force that unraveled conspiracies, exposed corruption, and brought long-hidden truths to light.

Once a beacon of prosperity, Lauria now finds itself embroiled in a web of intrigue. Whispers of a monstrous creature lurking in the harbor have crippled trade. The city guard seems powerless, and the whispers turn to accusations against the Oracle.  Kynos sees this as his greatest challenge yet.  Can he unravel Lauria's mystery plagues, or will the city succumb to fear and paranoia?
