### Origin

Arthur was born under a blood-red moon, an omen some whispered was a sign of Artheros' favor. He wasn't a strong child, nor a particularly gifted one. Yet, a strange calmness resided within him. He wasn't afraid of death, a stark contrast to those surrounding him. His stillness when his parents perished proved to be too much for the elders of his village.  He soon found himself a pariah and decided to travel to far-off lands.

Stumbling onto Theros, his calmness amidst the chaos of battle drew the attention of a shadowy sect within Artheros' clergy dedicated to ensuring the smooth passage of souls or the prevention thereof. They saw Arthur as a vessel for their teachings. They trained him in the rituals of death, the art of wielding twilight magic, and the sacred duty of ushering souls to the underworld. He learned of the delicate balance – a natural order where life must inevitably give way to death. Arthur never reveled in death but embraced his role as a shepherd of souls, ensuring a peaceful transition and protecting those on the precipice of their final journey.

  

### Appearance

Arthur doesn't stand out in a crowd. His physical stature is average, and his demeanor is reserved. He wears simple, dark clothing with a silver pendant depicting the ferryman, symbolizing his sect. His robes are worn and frayed; when he stands at sunset, his robes reflect Nyx’s night sky.

## Features

### Telekinetic

Source: Level 2 bonus feat

You learn to move things with your mind, granting you the following benefits:

• Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

• You learn the mage hand cantrip. You can cast it without verbal or somatic components and make the spectral hand invisible. If you already know this spell, its range increases by 30 feet when cast. Its spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat. 

  

• As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward you or away

  

### War caster

Source: Racial bonus

Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell.

You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:

You have an advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.

You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.

When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and target only that creature.

### Eyes Of Night

1st-level Twilight Domain feature

You can see through the deepest gloom. You have darkvision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

As an action, you can magically share the darkvision of this feature with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). The shared darkvision lasts for 1 hour. Once you share it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to share it again. 

### Vigilant Blessing

1st-level Twilight Domain feature

The night has taught you to be vigilant. As an action, you give one creature you touch (including possibly yourself) advantage on the next initiative roll the creature makes. This benefit ends immediately after the roll or if you use this feature again. 

### Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary

2nd-level Twilight Domain feature:

You can use your Channel Divinity to refresh your allies with soothing twilight. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:

• You grant it temporary hit points equal to ld6 plus your cleric level.

• You end one effect on it, causing it to be charmed or frightened.
